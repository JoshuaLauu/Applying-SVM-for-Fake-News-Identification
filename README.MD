# Applying SVM for Fake News Identification

## Project Overview
This project utilizes Support Vector Machines (SVM) to identify and classify fake news. It includes two main notebooks:

- `Machine Learning - Compared Models.ipynb`: This notebook compares various machine learning models to determine the most effective one for fake news identification.
- `Machine Learning - SVM Model.ipynb`: This notebook focuses on using the SVM model for the identification and classification of fake news.

## Background
In today's digital era, the rapid spread of misinformation has become a critical issue. Detecting fake news is crucial to maintaining trust in digital communication. This project leverages Support Vector Machines (SVM) to provide an effective solution for identifying fake news articles, ensuring information integrity and promoting media literacy.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes news articles from various sources, which have been pre-labeled as "true" or "fake."

- Dataset file: `Dataset.rar`

## Quick Start
To run these notebooks, ensure you have the following dependencies installed in your environment:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas sklearn matplotlib
